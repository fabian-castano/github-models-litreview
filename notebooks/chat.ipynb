      "Vaccine supply chain optimization has become a critical area of research in recent years, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has highlighted the need for efficient and effective vaccine distribution and allocation strategies. This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research in vaccine supply chain optimization, covering models, methods, and applications. The review spans a range of topics, including vaccine supply chain design and optimization, distribution and allocation strategies, inventory management and production planning, and emerging trends and technologies in vaccine supply chain management. The analysis of the existing literature reveals a growing interest in using mathematical programming, stochastic modeling, and simulation to address the complex challenges of vaccine supply chain management. The review also highlights the importance of considering multiple objectives, such as minimizing costs, maximizing vaccine availability, and ensuring equity in vaccine distribution. Furthermore, the review identifies a number of emerging trends and technologies, including the use of blockchain, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things, which have the potential to transform vaccine supply chain management. The review concludes by identifying future research directions and highlighting the need for more practical applications and case studies of vaccine supply chain optimization. Overall, this review aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the current state of research in vaccine supply chain optimization, and to identify opportunities for future research and practice.\n",
