In response, researchers have been actively exploring various optimization models, methods, and applications to improve vaccine supply chain performance. This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on vaccine supply chain optimization, covering topics such as supply chain design, distribution and allocation strategies, inventory management and production planning, as well as emerging trends and technologies. The review methodology involves a thorough analysis of 20 relevant studies, including case studies and applications of vaccine supply chain optimization in various contexts. The findings highlight the importance of considering multiple factors, such as vaccine availability, demand, and storage capacity, when designing and optimizing vaccine supply chains. The review also identifies a range of optimization models and methods, including mathematical programming, simulation, and machine learning, that have been applied to vaccine supply chain problems. Furthermore, the review discusses the role of emerging trends and technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, in enhancing vaccine supply chain performance. Overall, this systematic review provides a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners seeking to improve vaccine supply chain efficiency and effectiveness, ultimately contributing to better public health outcomes.'"
