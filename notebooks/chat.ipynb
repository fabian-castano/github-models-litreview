With the increasing demand for vaccines, the complexities of vaccine supply chains have become more pronounced, necessitating the development of innovative models, methods, and applications to optimize their performance. Recent studies have focused on designing and optimizing vaccine supply chains, taking into account factors such as cold chain logistics, transportation management, and inventory control. Various distribution and allocation strategies have been proposed, including multi-objective optimization models and stochastic programming approaches, to ensure equitable and efficient vaccine distribution. Furthermore, emerging trends and technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain, have been explored for their potential to enhance vaccine supply chain management. Case studies and applications have demonstrated the effectiveness of these approaches in real-world settings, highlighting the need for further research and development in this area. This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of vaccine supply chain optimization, highlighting the key models, methods, and applications that have been developed to address the complex challenges of vaccine distribution and administration. By synthesizing the existing literature, this review seeks to identify future research directions and inform the development of more effective vaccine supply chain management strategies.'"
